___

### Post-work

* Apply what you've learned in all your previous projects and homeworks. You don't need to re-submit PR, but ask other people for a review if you have any doubts.
* From now on, when doing reviews to other people, pay attention to the best practices presented ðŸ™‚
* From boredom, return to tasks on [Firecode.io](https://www.firecode.io) ðŸ™‚
* Review the headings from [CppCoreGuidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md), and in your spare time read as much as you can ðŸ™‚
